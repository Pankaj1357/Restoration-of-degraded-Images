# Restoration-of-degraded-Images
Wiener and Inverse filtering

<ul>
 <li>Implemented degradation filter for atmospheric turbulence and motion blur to degrade the clean images at
various noisy intensity levels.</li>
<li>Restored the degraded images using Inverse and Wiener filtering techniques and estimated RRMSE at various
noise intensity levels.</li>
</ul>
